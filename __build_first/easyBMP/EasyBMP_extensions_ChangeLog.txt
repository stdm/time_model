Date: 9-9-2005
Notes for Release 0.66.00:
    First numbered release to include all add-ons as a 
    grouped package.
    
    Included EasyBMP_SimpleArray.h, EasyBMP_Geometry.h, 
    and EasyBMP_Font.h, which were previously separately 
    available as add-ons.
    
    Included the new EasyBMP_win32.h, which has major 
    contributions from Michael Nistler.
    
    Included sample application, EasyBMP_win32_sample.cpp, 
    to test Geometry, Font, and win32. This code has 
    contributions from Michael Nistler.
    
    Included the new EasyBMP_OpenGL.h.

    Included easybmp_opengl_sample.cpp, as a sample appli-
    cation to test EasyBMP_OpenGL.h.

    Updated to the BSD (revised/modified) license.

    Updated formatting of change log.

Notes for Release 1.04.00:
    Renamed Round( double ) to ebmpRound( double ) to 
    prevent possible naming conflicts in 
    EasyBMP_Geometry.h.
    
    Replaced the BYTE type with ebmpBYTE in 
    EasyBMP_Geometry.h to ensure compatibility with recent
    versions of EasyBMP. (Recall that BYTE was renamed to
    ebmpBYTE to ensure 64-bit compatibility without naming
    conflicts.)
    
    Added a preprocessor #ifndef to the COPYRIGHT_SYMBOL 
    in EasyBMP_Font.h
    
    Separated EasyBMP_Font.h and EasyBMP_Geometry.h into 
    *.h and *.cpp files to ensure compatibility with large
    projects containing multiple cpp files. (In the prev-
    ious header file-only configuration, the 
    EasyBMP_Font.h and EasyBMP_Geometry.h functions were 
    compiled into every object file that included them, 
    leading to conflicts when linking the object files.) 
    
    Separated functions into separate cpp files for 
    EasyBMP_win32.h, EasyBMP_OpenGL.h, and 
    EasyBMP_SimpleArray.h. Again, this is to ensure com-
    patibility with larger projects. 
    
    Removed the restriction that textures must at least 64
    pixels wide in the CalculateOpenGLwidth() function in 
    EasyBMP_OpenGL.cpp, as it was based on a misunder-
    standing of the "red book" text. 
    
    Merged the CalculateOpenGLwidth() and 
    CalculateOpenGLheight() functions into a single 
    CalculateOpenGLlength() function in EasyBMP_OpenGL.cpp
    
    Added functions GetPixel() and SetPixel() to the 
    EasyBMP_Texture in EasyBMP_OpenGL.* to directly change
    texture pixels. 
    
    Modified the BMP_Texture:ImportBMP() function to de-l
    ete any pre-existing texture to plug a memory hole. 
    
    Created a new OpenGL example to demonstrate both sta-
    tic and changing textures. This sample has much better
    commenting. 
    
    Removed the alpha channel from OpenGL texture mapping
    to reduce complexity. Alpha channel may return in a 
    future version.
    
    Split various samples into separate directories. The 
    OpenGL sample is in OpenGL_Sample/, the Geometry/Font 
    sample is in GeometryAndFont_Sample/, and the win32 
    sample is in win32_sample/.

    Split the font test source into multiple cpp files to
    test including the Geometry and Font extensions in 
    large projects with multiple source files.

Notes for Release 1.05.00:
    The following additions were made to 
    EasyBMP_OpenGL.cpp and EasyBMP_OpenGL.h:

    1) bool EasyBMP_Screenshot( const char* FileName );
     
       This function takes a screenshot and saves it to 
       the file FileName. 
        
    2) bool EasyBMP_StartFilming( void );
     
       This function is used to start filming a movie at a
       default frame rate of 15.0 fps. It is generally
       best to use the EasyBMP_ToggleFilming() function 
       instead. (See below.)
     
    3) bool EasyBMP_StartFilming( double fps );
    
       This function is used to start filming a moive at a
       framerate of <fps> frames per second. It is gener-
       ally best to use the EasyBMP_ToggleFilming(double)
       function instead. (See below.)
    
    4) bool EasyBMP_ContinueFilming( void );
    
       This function is used to continue filming a movie
       if it is detected that filming has been initializ-
       ed. If you intend to film, you must place this 
       function in your display() function just before or
       after you swap buffers. It's okay to put it in your
       idle function before you post a redisplay(), too.
       
    5) bool EasyBMP_EndFilming( void );
    
       This function is used to cease filming. Generally,
       it's best to use the EasyBMP_ToggleFilming() and/or
       EasyBMP_ToggleFilming(double) functions. (See be-
       low.)
       
    6) bool EasyBMP_ToggleFilming( void );
    
       Use this function to toggle filming at a default 
       frame rate of 15 frames per second on or off. 
       
    7) bool EasyBMP_ToggleFilming( double fps );
    
       Use this function to toggle filming at a framge 
       rate of <fps> frames per second on or off.
      
    Changed the OpenGL code sample in 
    OpenGL_Sample/EasyBMP_OpenGL_Sample.cpp in the follow-
    ing ways:
    
    1) Added a keyboard function with the following keys:
    
       Q) Quits the demo program.
       
       S) Takes a screenshot and saves to screenshot.bmp
       
       F) Toggles filming at 15.0 frames per second on/off
       
       P) Pauses/Unpauses

    2) Added Paused boolean variable, and modified the 
       Idle() function to sleep if it's set to true.  
       
    Modified the OpenGL_Sample makefile to remove any 
    movie frames and/or screenshot files.
